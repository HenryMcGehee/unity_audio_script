# unity_audio_script

This script works best when used with animation events. Just attach the play audio script to your character prefab and call the script along with the associated sounds name. The each sound has a clip array that can hold as many sfx as you want. The play back and pitch of these sounds are random. The pitch range can be ajusted in the audio class file. The mixer output of each sound can also be customized in the inspector.
